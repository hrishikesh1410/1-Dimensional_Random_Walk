1-Dimensional_Random_Walk
Project: Interactive Study of One-Dimensional Random Walks 
Overview

This project is a browser-based interactive study of one-dimensional random walks, combining simulation, animation, and rigorous explanation. It is designed to connect theoretical ideas from probability with computational experiments and visualization.

Features

Animated visualization of a single random walk on a number line

User-controlled number of steps, speed, and step bias

Monte Carlo simulations of many independent walks

Interactive plots showing distribution convergence

Real-time tracking of path statistics such as extrema and range

Clear distinction between single-path behavior and distributional behavior

Web-paper section explaining the theory from basic to advanced concepts

Technology

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Plotly for interactive plots

MathJax for rendering mathematical explanations

How to Run

Open index.html in any modern web browser. No installation or build steps required.

Purpose

The project is intended for students and researchers interested in probability, statistics, and stochastic processes. It emphasizes mathematical correctness, reproducibility, and intuition through interactive visualization.
